PhxSql-Specific Installation Notes
====================================

*** NOTE FOR 64-BIT LINUX SYSTEMS

The PhxSql library has to be built on 64-bit systems or you may
experience some problems.

Basic Installation
==================

Briefly, the shell commands `./autoinstall.sh; make;make install' should 
configure and build this package. The following more-detailed instructions 
are generic. 
   The `autoinstall.sh' shell script attempts to guess correct values 
for various system-dependent variables used during compilation. It 
uses those values and Makefile.define in each directory which describes 
the source files infomation to create a `Makefile' in each directory of 
the package. 

   The file `makefile.mk' is used to set options of the compilation 
environment. You need modify it if you want to change the options including
the paths of the third party libraries, like glog, leveldb, and protobuf.

The simplest way to compile this package is:
  1. Make sure the third party libraries, such as protobuf (3.0 or above) 
  leveldb and glog, have been installed in the system. 
  Please make sure the CXXFLAGS '-fPIC' has been added while compiling thrid 
  party libraries.

  2. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./autoinstall.sh' to configure the package for your system.

  3. Type `make' to compile the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs to the destination directory.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source 
  code directory by typing `make clean'.  

Compilers and Options
=====================

Glibc 2.12 or above, as well as 64bit option and C++ 11 support in compiler,
is required to build the library.

If you want to include more options, modifying the makefile.mk file in 
the source code directory is a good idea.
