/**
 * {@code Cleaner} manages a set of object references and corresponding cleaning actions.
 * <p>
 * Cleaning actions are {@link #register(Object object, Runnable action) registered}
 * to run after the cleaner is notified that the object has become
 * phantom reachable.
 * The cleaner uses {@link PhantomReference} and {@link ReferenceQueue} to be
 * notified when the <a href="package-summary.html#reachability">reachability</a>
 * changes.
 * <p>
 * Each cleaner operates independently, managing the pending cleaning actions
 * and handling threading and termination when the cleaner is no longer in use.
 * Registering an object reference and corresponding cleaning action returns
 * a {@link Cleanable Cleanable}. The most efficient use is to explicitly invoke
 * the {@link Cleanable#clean clean} method when the object is closed or
 * no longer needed.
 * The cleaning action is a {@link Runnable} to be invoked at most once when
 * the object has become phantom reachable unless it has already been explicitly cleaned.
 * Note that the cleaning action must not refer to the object being registered.
 * If so, the object will not become phantom reachable and the cleaning action
 * will not be invoked automatically.
 * <p>
 * The execution of the cleaning action is performed
 * by a thread associated with the cleaner.
 * All exceptions thrown by the cleaning action are ignored.
 * The cleaner and other cleaning actions are not affected by
 * exceptions in a cleaning action.
 * The thread runs until all registered cleaning actions have
 * completed and the cleaner itself is reclaimed by the garbage collector.
 * <p>
 * The behavior of cleaners during {@link System#exit(int) System.exit}
 * is implementation specific. No guarantees are made relating
 * to whether cleaning actions are invoked or not.
 * <p>
 * Unless otherwise noted, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor or
 * method in this class will cause a
 * {@link java.lang.NullPointerException NullPointerException} to be thrown.
 *
 * @apiNote The cleaning action is invoked only after the associated object becomes
 * phantom reachable, so it is important that the object implementing the
 * cleaning action does not hold references to the object.
 * In this example, a static class encapsulates the cleaning state and action.
 * An "inner" class, anonymous or not,  must not be used because it implicitly
 * contains a reference to the outer instance, preventing it from becoming
 * phantom reachable.
 * The choice of a new cleaner or sharing an existing cleaner is determined
 * by the use case.
 * <p>
 * If the CleaningExample is used in a try-finally block then the
 * {@code close} method calls the cleaning action.
 * If the {@code close} method is not called, the cleaning action is called
 * by the Cleaner when the CleaningExample instance has become phantom reachable.
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class CleaningExample implements AutoCloseable {
 *        // A cleaner, preferably one shared within a library
 *        private static final Cleaner cleaner = <cleaner>;
 *
 *        static class State implements Runnable {
 *
 *            State(...) {
 *                // initialize State needed for cleaning action
 *            }
 *
 *            public void run() {
 *                // cleanup action accessing State, executed at most once
 *            }
 *        }
 *
 *        private final State;
 *        private final Cleaner.Cleanable cleanable
 *
 *        public CleaningExample() {
 *            this.state = new State(...);
 *            this.cleanable = cleaner.register(this, state);
 *        }
 *
 *        public void close() {
 *            cleanable.clean();
 *        }
 *    }
 * }</pre>
 * The cleaning action could be a lambda but all too easily will capture
 * the object reference, by referring to fields of the object being cleaned,
 * preventing the object from becoming phantom reachable.
 * Using a static nested class, as above, will avoid accidentally retaining the
 * object reference.
 * <p>
 * <a id="compatible-cleaners"></a>
 * Cleaning actions should be prepared to be invoked concurrently with
 * other cleaning actions.
 * Typically the cleaning actions should be very quick to execute
 * and not block. If the cleaning action blocks, it may delay processing
 * other cleaning actions registered to the same cleaner.
 * All cleaning actions registered to a cleaner should be mutually compatible.

/*
 * 清理器(公开)，内部默认使用虚引用完成对对象的跟踪。
 *
 * 注：此清理器与非公开的清理器jdk.internal.ref.Cleaner实现原理有些不一样。
 *
 * 下面就以虚引用清理器（PhantomCleanableRef）介绍Cleaner工作原理。
 *
 *                               ┌───█│█│█│█│█│█    ReferenceQueue
 * Cleaner───────CleanerImpl─────┤
 *                               └───▉│▉│▉│▉│▉  PhantomCleanableList
 *
 * 一个程序可以由多个清理器（Cleaner）。
 * 每个清理器（Cleaner）可以追踪多个对象（obj），每个对象都有特定的清理操作（action）。
 * 每当把一组[obj, action]注册给清理器（Cleaner），都会新建一个虚引用清理器（PhantomCleanableRef），并加入到虚引用清理器列表。
 * 虚引用清理器本身是个虚引用(PhantomReference)，它会跟踪此obj，并且记下其对应的action。
 * 每次GC时，JVM将回收只剩虚引用的obj，并将追踪它的虚引用（这里是PhantomCleanableRef）加入到ReferenceQueue。
 *
 * 每创建（create）一个清理器（Cleaner），就开启一个清理服务（CleanerImpl）。
 * 每个清理服务（CleanerImpl）运行在一个全新的守护线程中。
 * 且每个清理服务（CleanerImpl）内部缓冲一个上述的虚引用清理器列表。
 *
 * 清理服务的作用就是轮询"报废引用"队列（ReferenceQueue），只要该队列中有报废的引用（PhantomCleanableRef），
 * 就将其从ReferenceQueue和PhantomCleanableList中移除，并调用其相应的action。
 * 如果ReferenceQueue为空，清理服务陷入阻塞。
 *
 * 相较于Finalizer机制，Cleaner的改进之处在于被追踪对象与清理动作是分开的，因此只需要一次gc就可以释放被追踪对象所占内容。
 * 当然，如果清理动作内又持有了被追踪对象，则会造成该对象无法被回收，进而引起内存泄露。
 * 另外，Cleaner内部采用虚引用追踪对象，这意味着只要GC发生，该对象就会被自动回收到报废引用队列，而不像在Finalizer机制，需要手动置空被追踪对象的引用。
